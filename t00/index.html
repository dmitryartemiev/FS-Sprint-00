    <h2 id="example">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>
      Asuperhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do
      them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
      superhero,
      <b>
        you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human
        being could possess</b
      >, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a
      policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. <br> For instance, a
      good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or
      detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a
      superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the
      good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do,
      couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

    <p>
      Anthony Edward Stark is a fictional character portrayed by Robert Downey
      Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise—based on the
      Marvel Comics character of the same name—commonly known by his alter ego,
      Iron Man. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero
      and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. At the beginning of the
      series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he
      has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the
      creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against
      those that would threaten peace around the world.
